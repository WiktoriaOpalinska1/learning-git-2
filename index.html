        <p> Last Christmas I gave you my heart <br>
            But the very next day you gave it away <br>
            This year, to save me from tears <br>
            I'll give it to someone special

        <p> Once bitten and twice shy <br>
            I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye <br>
            Tell me baby, do you recognize me? <br>
            Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
        </p>    
        <p> Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it <br>
            With a note saying "I love you", I meant it <br>
            Now I know what a fool I've been <br>
            But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
        </p>

        <p><b> Ooh <br>
            Oh, oh, baby</b>
        </p>
        <p> A crowded room, friends with tired eyes <br>
            I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice <br>
            My God, I thought you were someone to rely on <br>
            Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
        </p>
        <p> A face on a lover with a fire in his heart <br>
            A man under cover, but you tore me apart <br>
            Oh, oh now I've found a real love <br>
            You'll never fool me again
        </p>
